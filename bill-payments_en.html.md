* User submits an order on the merchantâ€™s website or application.

* Merchant redirects the user to [QIWI Kassa Pay Form](#http) link to issue an invoice for the order and to make the user pay for it.

* The user chooses the most convenient way to pay for the invoice on the Pay Form.

* The merchant's service receives [notification](#notification) once the invoice is successfully paid by the user. You need to enable notifications on your [Personal Page](https://kassa.qiwi.com).

* If needed, via [Bill Payments REST API](#bill-payments-api) merchant can:
  * [request current status](#invoice-status) of the invoice,
  * [cancel invoice](#cancel) (if the user has not initiated payment yet).

* When the invoice payment is confirmed, merchant delivers ordered services/goods.
